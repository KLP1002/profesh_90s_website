  <h3>"Eye of newt, and toe of frog,
    <br>
Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,
<br>
Adder's fork, and blind-worm's sting,
<br>
Lizard's leg, and howlet's wing,--
<br>
For a charm of powerful trouble,
<br>
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble."
<br>
<br>
Macbeth (IV, i, 14-15)

<p> "Some salamander species are fully aquatic throughout their lives, some take to the water intermittently, and others are entirely terrestrial as adults. They are capable of regenerating lost limbs, as well as other damaged parts of their bodies. Researchers hope to reverse engineer the remarkable regenerative processes for potential human medical applications, such as brain and spinal cord injury treatment or preventing harmful scarring during heart surgery recovery."
